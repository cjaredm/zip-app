# Wes Bos - Advanced React Course

## HELP!!!
I've got my backend running well. Its not the same as Wes' because I'm using the new Keystone 6 version. Slight differences but mostly all the same.

On the frontend I can query anything it seems, no issues.
**BUT** as soon as I try and sign in, I get an error about not being able to connect to the backend.

Any help would be appreciated. I've tried several things and looked all over with little luck.
